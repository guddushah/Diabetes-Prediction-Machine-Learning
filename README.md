# Diabetes Prediction System

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
I delved into the data understanding the diagnostic measurement needed to confirm whether the patient is having diabetes or not. Built a Machine Learning model using Decision Tree Algorithm, implemented HTML, CSS in building interactive webpage and Django web framework for backend connectivity. Health Professionals can use this dynamic webpage for predicting the Diabetes in patients by feeding metrics from the medical report.

### DATASET DESCRIPTION
This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary goal is to predict the presence of diabetes in patients by analyzing specific diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset. The selection criteria for the dataset were stringent, including only female individuals who are at least 21 years old and belong to the Pima Indian heritage.
 
### EXECUTION:
#### Data Analysis in jupyter notebook:
1. Downloaded the dataset and discovered that the data is compiled for predictive analysis. 
 2. Loaded the dataset into jupyter notebook for further analysis and visualizing data distributions.
3. Imported necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data analysis task.
4. Performed EDA and Preprocessing during data analysis for machine learning.
5. Employed Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Algorithms during model building. Decision Tree gave the best accuracy of 83%, therefore implemented Decision Tree for building ML model and saved the model in savedModels directory.

#### Frontend and Backend in VS Code:
1. Installed Django and created project MLDeployment.
2. Created static directory for storing files like images and templates directory for storing html files.
3. Made use of HTML and CSS for building home.html and predict.html pages.
3. Under MLDeployment project created an app DiabetesApp.
4. Created views. py file under DiabetesApp directory for defining the logic and overall structure of the website.
5. Created urls. py file inside DiabetesApp for adding path of webpages.
6. Demonstrated the project running the Django server and performed the prediction task by feeding diagnostic measurements.
